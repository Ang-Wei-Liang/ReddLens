ReddLens – your all-in-one chrome extension lens for Reddit posts. This is still a work in progress, there is prompt engineering to do for phrase for better results, and errors messages in the console.

Slap on one (or all) of these 5 chaotic-good lenses:

🧙‍♂️ Mage Lens 
- generate an AI image based on the post. Uses a free image api (pollinations ai) so image might not be the best, but can definitely be resolved with better prompt engineering.

🌈 Positive Lens
- rewrites self-pity posts and ragebait titles into something that doesn’t make you want to eat drywall

⚖️ Objective Lens
- slaps a reality check on exagerrated views underneath

📉 TL;DR Lens
- “ain't reading all that”, Auto-summarizes the post into digestible chunks

🤣 Funny Lens
- roasts, rewrites, and reboots the post with a dash of humor so even serious rants turn into comedy gold
